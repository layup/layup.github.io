                <p>
                    Having completed my Computer Science degree at the University of Victoria, 
                    I am now working on developing applications that can help connect people in a simple and easy-to-use way. 
                    I strive to leverage the latest technologies and the expertise of others to make the technology widely accessible
                    and usable by all.
